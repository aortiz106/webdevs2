        <h2>About Me</h2><p>Hello, my name is Alejandro Ortiz, and i am the programer of this site. I decided to make this site for a friend of mine (and for myself). both of us are big fans of RPGs particularly "Dungeons and Dragons". this page was done to be used with Dugeons and Dragons. it is simple project (less than 400 lines of code) and was fairly fun to do. Thanks for DMing Dungeons and Dragons for us Zane and keeping up with all the crazy senarios we put you through<br>
        </p> <img src= ""> <h2>About This Project</h2><p>When I started this project I thought i would have more time. The deadline caught up with me quickly and before I knew it, it was due monday. I did eventually get the program working and i was pretty proud of the results and suprized how well it came out looking. I did have to work out some minor problems (okay they might not have been that minor, or easy to solve but nothing a good cup of coffe and determination couldn't fix) and eventually I had finally completed I project I was proud of. That's most of the story of how this page came to be, it was difficult but ot was fun and worth the expirience (like playing "dark souls" but with less giving up.) </p> </center>
